        </h5>
        <p>One of InkSoft's core products is their Apparel Designer which is a HTML5/AngularJS 1.x web application. The application
          gives users the ability to create custom designs on various apparel such as t-shirts, sweatshirts, pants, long sleeves, etc.
          Our customers embed this designer application in their website so that their customers can go onto their site and make purchases with
          custom designed apparel. The designer also has a full checkout and cart experience which allows them to make orders right there on our
          clients website. InkSoft wanted to expand the apparel designer to meet the needs of our customers by providing them with an online designer
          specific for sign and banner products.

          <span>Process and Solution</span>
        </h5>
        <p>The process started out with myself, the Product Owner, and InkSoft's Lead Designer gathering data and doing research about the product.
          We researched other Sign/Banner designers already on the market, we gathered feedback from InkSoft's Sales and Support team because they are the
          ones who talk to our customers the most. We got feedback from our "InkSoft Advisors" group which is a user group that helps us with usability tests and what not.
          After we were done researching we started writing out our User Stories and scoping the project out. Our Lead Designer and myself then started working on the UI/UX design
          of the project. One of our goals for this designer to set us apart from a lot of the other online designers out there was to make the UX feel like a
          modern and rich application experience. Our apparel designer is an app that gets embedded in a page and has a fixed width of 960px and just gets placed inside
          of whatever container div the user decides on. It just feels a little out dated compared to today's rich web applications. With the Signs and
          Banners Designer we wanted the app to take over the entire web page. This way the user is fully immersed in the moment when he or she is designing their
          product. They won't be distracted by surrounding noise such as advertisements, headers, footers, or whatever else.
        </p>
        <p>Once the design was approved, myself and a few other Javascript developers started building it out. We kept the Signs and Banners
          designer in the same app as the Apparel Designer because they were going to share a lot of the same functionality. So essentially, the Signs and Banners Designer was a
          theme off of the Apparel designer. The Signs and Banners Designer has a completely different UI. Even though they share some methods, there was a lot of new functionality
          that had to be coded out. While I architected the UI, the other JS devs that specialize in the HTML5 Canvas API focused on that portion. One of the most
          fun parts about this project was working on UI animation. Animation in web apps can be a tricky thing. You don't want to over do it nor do you want the
          animations to feel laggy or make the app feel slow. At the time of me writing this, we are actually still in the first phase of this project. Currently, a user still
          has to manually create all their sign and banner products in InkSoft's backend. We are working on integrations with a distribution partner that will allow
          a print shop that doesn't provide their own sign product to tie in to this integration and be provided with an extensive library of sign and
          banner products. We have received lots great feedback thus far on the new designer!
