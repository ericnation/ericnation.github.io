            <p>
              Georgetown University was already an existing client of my
              employer, Alley Interactive. They had hired us for another
              contract to build out a web application called The Children's
              Health Care Report Card. It was a data visualization web site that
              showed the number of uninsured children in the United States and
              related statistics. They wanted to be able to manage all their
              content and upload excel spreadsheets of all their data to
              Wordpress. It was our task to parse that data and represent it
              visually in a variety of infographic components. Being that this
              was a website owned and managed by the university and it was
              expressing government data, the website also had to meet
              accessibility requirements.

              <span>Process and Solution</span>
            </h5>
            <p>
              Alley Interactive being an elite Wordpress agency our obvious
              choice for content management was Wordpress. This also allowed the
              client to upload all their spreadsheets and organize them per
              indicator category. We used Gutenberg, Wordpress’s new editor
              interface, and built a custom block that allowed them to upload
              these files. We sanitized and parse the data to organize it in the
              manner we wanted to send it to the front-end. On the front-end we
              used Redux to manage the application’s data and state.

              I loved this project and had so much fun working on it. It was a
              great learning experience for custom Gutenberg block development,
              data parsing, and building data visualization components on the
              front end. The client was a pleasure to work with and we had
              weekly check in meetings. This project was delivered on time, on
              budget, and the client was thrilled with the results!

              that compiles your code for you and publishes it to npm. The IUI
              component library played a crucial role in allowing InkSoft’s
              offshore development team in India to build out new features and
              stay consistent with the rest of our products.
