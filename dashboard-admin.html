              InkSoft’s Dashboard for our Admin app was old, outdated, and not very attractive looking. It needed a makeover, the
              legacy Dashboard didn’t have much even on it and it was lacking anything useful. It was just a simple landing page the
              user was directed to after logging into our system.

            </h5>
            <p>
              We already had a handful of feedback requests from our customers on features and information they would want on the
              Dashboard page. Some of these features were alerts for the system, Quick Links panel, general order information, Store
              data, and quick actions. I love the sleek Design that our designer came up with for this page! We also designed our own
              svg icons. This project was built in Angular 1.x and I had a lot of fun building it! Once it was released we got a lot
              of positive input from our customers.
